This project is, in practice, dead. I was keeping the code to myself, but have
decided to put it on github just in case.

The idea with this project was to build a MUCH better version of the tournament
organization system at tournament organization system at
https://www.1playerplace.com/

This component was the logic for parsing tournament standings in the vaguely
proprietary TOM format.



The old README follows:

Plans:

Parity with https://www.1playerplace.com/
=========================================
DONE, but ugly: 1) Allow user to edit player IDs + save in the session
2) Visualization of pairings
3) Upload button for new rounds
4) Performance testing -- 500+ users at once
